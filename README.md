- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mayuresh Sawant (A00442519). MCDA student @ SMU, Halifax.  
- I come from Mumbai, India where I also completed my Bachelors in Electronics Engineering back in 2018. Since then, I worked as an Agile Software Engineer with Tata Consultancy Services until early 2020. I developed Restful Java web apps for a banking client and worked extensively writing shell and Python scripts. After leaving my job at TCS, I worked as a Data Science fellow @ Fellowship.AI where I had a chance to work on some interesting Machine Learning problems with a group of very diverse and qualified group of individuals. I later worked as a Data Science intern @ Mibolsillo generating insights and developing hypothesis related to credit risk variables for the underbanked and unbanked.
- After the first class, I was excited to learn that the course is not a general programming course but it'll cover the entire SDLC including project management sessions. Really looking forward to the classes ahead. 
- I do have experience with Java but I've lost some touch with it. Recently, moost of my work has been with Python so I'm very well versed with that. Unfortunately I haven't worked with .NET and C# ever, but I'm working on it so I don't fall behind in the future classes.
